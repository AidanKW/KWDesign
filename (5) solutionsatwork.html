                    <b>Summary:</b> Solutions at Work, a nonprofit in Cambridge, MA, faced significant challenges in engaging potential donors online. Their
                    outdated website and fragmented design lacked alignment with their mission to foster empowerment and dignity for
                    underserved populations. My role was to modernize their online presence while keeping the focus on user experience and
                    ethical communication.

                <h2><B>Empathy Phase: Understanding User Needs</B></h2>
                <p>
                    Before beginning the redesign, I focused on deeply understanding the needs of two key user groups: donors and
                    beneficiary. For donors, the goal was to ensure that the website instilled trust and made donating as intuitive as
                    possible. For the beneficiaries, it was about enabling them to easily locate resources.
                    <br><br>
                    To achieve this, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the existing site and interviewed colleagues about pain points. I
                    also reviewed competitor websites to identify patterns and best practices. A critical insight from this phase was that
                    <b>donors respond more positively over time to messages of empowerment and impact rather than guilt-driven
                    narratives.</b> Guilt-driven narratives, besides their inherent unethicality, only encouraged one time
                    donations in the majority of users. In addition, I confirmed that <b>outdated content and poor mobile usability were
                    major deterrents for potential donors.</b>
                </p>

                <h2><B>Define Phase: Framing the Problem</B></h2>
                <p>
                    I aimed to answer the question: How might we create an intuitive, accessible, and empowering online
                    experience that encourages donations and supports
                    the organization’s mission?
                    <br><br>
                    From my previous work, I identified these core problems:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The outdated website design hindered trust and engagement with donors.</li>
                    <li>The information hierarchy and lack of information scent made critical details (e.g., how to
                        donate) difficult to find</li>
                    <li>The site wasn’t optimized for mobile, despite significant mobile traffic.</li>

                <h2><B>Ideation Phase: Exploring Solutions Beyond the Obvious</B></h2>
                <p>
                    Rather than jumping into a direct redesign, I took a step back to consider the broader user experience. I explored
                    multiple concepts, focusing on ideas that would emphasize trust and impact while reducing friction in the donor journey.
                    <br><br>
                    Based on my findings, <b>I decided to limit header options to avoid cluttering the navigation.</b> I also reframed the
                    website's messaging to celebrate the positive impact of donations, aligning with the organization’s mission and donor
                    values.
                    <br><br>
                    I created wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes, which I shared with staff and test users to gather feedback. These
                    iterative sessions helped me refine solutions, such as emphasizing key calls to action and simplifying the mobile
                    interface to reduce cognitive load.

                <h2><B>Prototype and Test: Validating Solutions</B></h2>
                <p>
                    Using the feedback gathered during ideation, I developed a high-fidelity prototype using Figma and conducted further
                    internal user testing. Then, I created and published the website using in WordPress. After installing Hotjar to track
                    user metrics, <b>I used A/B testing to compare different layouts and styles, focusing on metrics such as bounce rate and
                    click-through rate.</b> <br><br>

                    One critical test involved redesigning the donation page for mobile users, as many were scrolling up and down searching
                    for information. The streamlined version reduced the bounce rate by 11%. Another test addressed confusion around
                    navigation, where users mistook headers for buttons. Adjustments to the header style clarified the interaction, reducing
                    misclicks.

                <p>
                    The final solution included a responsive website with a clean, user-centered design. I implemented a design system to
                    ensure consistency and scalability for future updates. Post-launch, I monitored user behavior with Hotjar, making
                    iterative improvements based on data-driven insights. <br><br>

                    The results speak to the success of this approach: <b>a 24% increase in donations, 32% higher traffic, and a 60%
                    reduction in support emails.</b> These outcomes demonstrate how thoughtful, research-driven design can directly
                    impact both user experience and organizational goals.

                        design.</li>
                    <li> <b>Decision</b>: While I implemented necessary temporary changes to improve functionality
                        immediately, I proposed and executed a complete
                        redesign based on user research, ensuring long-term usability and alignment with the
                        organization's goals.</li>
                    <li> <b>Impact</b>: The new design not only improved mobile compatibility and accessibility but also
                        led to a 24% increase in donations and
                        a significant reduction in support emails.

                        potentially cluttering the interface.</li>
                    <li> <b>Decision</b>: I respectfully disagreed and advocated for a minimalist approach, focusing the

                        high-priority actions
                        like donating and learning about the organization. I backed this decision with user research
                        showing that simplicity

                    <li> <b>Impact</b>: The streamlined navigation improved clarity and ensured donors could easily find

                        cluttering the main navigation with extra
                        pages risked overwhelming users.</li>
                    <li> <b>Decision</b>: Instead of making the pages public-facing, I designed them to be accessible

                <p>
                    To ensure the website effectively supported the organization’s mission, I began by studying established design systems
                    like M3 and Shopify. While the scope of our site was smaller, these systems inspired scalable, user-focused principles
                    that guided my decisions.<br><br>
                    
                    The website’s primary goal was to encourage donations, so I focused on creating a welcoming and accessible experience.
                    My research included a review of over 12 partner organizations to understand visual and content strategies that
                    resonated with similar audiences. Key design decisions included
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Visual Identity</b>: Used bright, warm colors and rounded containers to create an approachable and optimistic aesthetic.</li>
                    <li><b>Accessibility</b>: Ensured high text contrast (7:1 minimum), alt text for all images, and a reading level appropriate for a broad audience.</li>
                    <li><b>User Celebration</b>: Targeted donors as the primary audience with positive, empowering language over guilt-driven messaging.</li>
                </ul>


                <p>
                    Additionally, I prioritized responsive design, ensuring the layout worked seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile
                    devices.<br><br>
                    
                    Although creating a formal design system might seem ambitious for a small nonprofit, this project was an invaluable
                    opportunity to deepen my expertise. By studying industry-leading systems and adapting them to our needs, I not only
                    improved the website’s usability and consistency but also grew significantly as a designer.
