                    <b>Summary:</b> I work at the Cambridge, Massachusetts nonprofit Solutions at Work. The organization suffered from a terribly dated website and social media. As such, I single handedly modernized their entire online presence by overhauling the website, creating infographics, a design system, conducting user research, and more.

                    I completely overhauled the online presence of Solutions at Work. It began with an assessment of the website. The
                    interface was cluttered, and was nearly unusable on mobile. Furthermore, the information was months out of date with no
                    consistency in the information hierarchy. So, I created a design system to overhaul the entire website’s content and
                    design. Since the redesign, I conduct user research on the website using Hotjar.<br><br>
                    
                    Additionally, I volunteer as a technical administrator. I manage organization emails, domain certificates, writing and
                    sending newsletters to over 1300 people, and managing our contacts database. Furthermore, I serve on the media committee
                    where we make decisions for upcoming events and donation drives.

                    My design process began by reviewing some well known design systems - namely M3 and Shopify. The website is meant
                    primarily to convince users to donate to the cause, so I knew the system need not be very in-depth. Then, I did some
                    brief reviews of the 100+ organizations we have partnered with in the past. From there I made the following design
                    decisions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our primary target users are people who can donate, not people in need of donations</li>
                    <li>For ethical reasons, we will use positive language to celebrate making a difference over guilting users about how
                    difficult it is to be homeless</li>
                    <li>In addition to positive language, we will use bright and warm colors</li>
                    <li>Our website containers will have rounded edges</li>
                </ul>

                    <li> Reading level of content must be kept beneath secondary school reading level</li>
                    <li> Removal of time-sensitive content</li>
                    <li>Layout must work on desktop, tablet, and mobile</li>

                    Design systems pose serious advantages - creating designs are much quicker, fewer revisions are needed, and they allow entire
                    organisations to maintain consistency. This consistency persists no matter the size of the organisation or if
                    assignments change hands. <br><br>
                    
                    However, design systems require a lot of effort to update and maintain. One small change could cause ripples which take several
                    hours to apply. In other words, design systems promote efficiency within consistency, but require extra effort to remain
                    flexible.

                    If you are wondering, yes it is nearing ridiculous to make an entire design system for an organization of this small of
                    a size. However, it was an opportunity for me to learn and so I seized it with both arms! While the scope of the designs
                    I make for this organization are limited, by studying Shopify and M3's design systems in depth, I have definitively
                    grown as a designer.

                    As the only designer on the team, I’ve been fortunate to have the control enough to design and run my own user tests. By
                    analyzing heatmaps and viewing user recordings, I have been able to make demonstrable improvements to user experience.

                    I have never met another group so passionate and hardworking just because they know it to be right. That alone has made
                    the entire experience worthwhile. There were a few pain points however, as are all working around other jobs and
                    responsibilities. A lack of resources is the most common. But, I have thoroughly enjoyed learning and improving beyond
                    my skills as a UX Designer.
