                    <b>Summary:</b> For my first design job, I worked at the tech startup Ronday Technologies on their
                    online 3D conferencing and hangout platform. As to be expected of startup work, I performed a myriad
                    of tasks both design-related and otherwise.

                    Working at Ronday was a blast. I found it delightful to work on an innovative project with
                    such a passionate team. I also had ample opportunities for self-growth, as I had to teach myself
                    graphic design, video editing, and more. <br><br>

                    The results speak for themselves. My wallboards are the default images on all of Ronday's most
                    popular maps. My Twitter Ads boast a conversion rate 20x higher than the industry average. My
                    research results have guided major decisions for the company.<br><br>

                    Here is a full list of my accomplishments at Ronday:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> I designed 130 wallboards (75 final versions), 3 user flows, and 4 high fidelity wireframes
                    </li>
                    <li> I created the majority (90%+) of the Ronday Help Center.</li>
                    <li> I wrote a user research plan. Then using that plan, I participated in 3 user interviews, and
                        led 3
                        more. </li>
                    <li> I performed competitive research on 13 competitors and presented my findings to the company.
                    </li>
                    <li> I also directed, recorded, and edited 5 Twitter advertisements and a Discord bot advertisement.
                    </li>
                    <li> Participated in countless design discussions to improve the Ronday platform. </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                    I was tasked with creating the help center. At the time, there were only a few pages:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
                    <li>Customizing wallboards</li>
                    <li>Managing the Ronday Group</li>
                    <li>Build notes, and a link to the Ronday platform</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    So, I worked alongside Senior Design employee Chris Tung to create an information hierarchy which outlined everything which
                    needed including.

                    Except for the Links category, each category had 3-4 individual pages. Every page had 3-7 sections of
                    written and visual content. For each page, I did the following process:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Write the script containing all necessary information </li>
                    <li> Verify that the writing was accessible (see photo)</li>
                    <li> Record and edit 10-30 second videos of me performing the task</li>
                    <li> Receive final feedback from co-workers</li>

                    I took great care to ensure that the articles were as succinct and accessible as possible. For
                    example, the original visual content were GIFs, but I know that autoplaying content which cannot be
                    paused is not accessible (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/enough-time.html">See
                        WCAG 2.2</a>).<br><br>

                    Through user testing, we determined what content was missing and what needed improvement. So the
                    development was an ongoing process which continues to this day.
