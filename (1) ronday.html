                    <b>Summary:</b> At the tech startup Ronday Technologies, I worked on their innovative 3D
                    conferencing and hangout platform. As a UX
                    Designer, I took charge of improving the onboarding process, enhancing feature discoverability, and
                    designing a more
                    user-friendly interface. My role encompassed a wide range of responsibilities, including creating
                    user flows, conducting
                    user research, performing competitive analyses, and designing high-fidelity wireframes. Startup life
                    also gave me
                    opportunities to branch out into other areas like graphic design, video production, and help center
                    creation.

                <h2><B>Feature Discoverability</B></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Challenge</b>: During user testing, we discovered that a new customizable profile icon
                        feature was rarely used,
                        despite prior research indicating high demand. The feature required users to hover over their
                        profile image, which few did.</li>
                    <li> <b>Ideation and Exploration</b>:I began by brainstorming initial solutions, including
                        variations of adding an "edit" pencil icon near the profile
                        picture. Recognizing the importance of stepping back, I researched best practices in
                        discoverability. I explored two additional solutions:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Adding Profile Picture Selection to Onboarding:</b> Introducing the feature during the
                            account setup process.</li>
                        <li><b>Consolidating Profile Editing Options:</b> Replacing separate buttons for name and icon
                            edits with a unified "Edit Profile" button leading to a menu.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li> <b>Impact</b>: I presented these concepts to the design team, emphasizing the consolidated
                        approach for its simplicity and improved
                        user flow. This solution was approved and implemented, resulting in a cleaner interface and
                        improved feature
                        discoverability.
                    </li>

                        the platform. At the time, the Ronday Help Center was just a few scattered pages.</li>
                    <li> <b>Ideation and Exploration</b>: Collaborating with Senior Designer Chris Tung, we developed an
                        information hierarchy that outlined all necessary content categories. From there, I independently 
                        took ownership of its development, completing 10 articles across 32 sections."
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Content Creation:</b> Authored concise and accessible text, verified readability using the Hemingway app, and produced visual aids (14 videos,
                            16 images).</li>
                            <li><b>WCAG Accessibility:</b> Improved inclusivity by replacing GIFs with user-controlled videos and meeting WCAG 2.2 standards.</li>
                            <li><b>Iterative Improvements:</b> Used user testing and feedback to identify missing content and enhance usability.</li>
                        </ol>
                    
                    <li> <b>Impact</b>: The Help Center reduced onboarding times by over 30%, making it an essential part of the user journey
                    </li>

                    Ronday’s shift to a new user demographic required a focused research effort. I designed and implemented a comprehensive
                    research plan, synthesizing qualitative insights from 6 user interviews. The plan included participant recruitment,

                <h2><b>Competitive Analysis</b></h2>
                <p>
                    To complement the user interviews, I conducted a thorough competitive analysis of 13 similar platforms to understand how
                    they approached usability, onboarding, and discoverability. My analysis focused on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Onboarding Flow:</b> Compared how competitors introduced their features to new users, identifying common patterns and unique approaches.
                    Benchmarked onboarding time and complexity, which influenced the redesign of Ronday’s own Help Center.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Feature Discoverability:</b> Assessed how competitors highlighted similar features (e.g., customizable profiles) within their interfaces.
                    Noted creative solutions, such as gamified tutorials, that informed our ideation for feature discoverability.</li>
                    <li><b>Accessibility Standards:</b> Evaluated whether competitor platforms adhered to WCAG guidelines, which helped Ronday position itself as a more
                    inclusive product.</li>
                    <li><b>User Retention Strategies:</b> Examined competitor methods for keeping users engaged, such as frequent updates or interactive elements.
                        inclusive product.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>The competitive analysis revealed several opportunity areas in Ronday’s UX, including improving onboarding clarity and marketing techniques.
                These insights directly shaped my contributions to the Help Center and the profile editing interface redesign.</p>
