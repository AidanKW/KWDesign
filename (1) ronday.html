                    <b>Summary:</b> For my first design job, I worked at the tech startup Ronday Technologies on their
                    online 3D conferencing and hangout platform. As to be expected of startup work, I performed a myriad
                    of tasks both design-related and otherwise.

                    Working at Ronday was a blast. I found it delightful to work on an innovative project with
                    such a passionate team. I also had ample opportunities for self-growth, as I had to teach myself
                    graphic design, video editing, and more. <br><br>

                    The results speak for themselves. My wallboards are the default images on all of Ronday's most
                    popular maps. My Twitter Ads boast a conversion rate 20x higher than the industry average. My
                    research results have guided major decisions for the company.<br><br>

                    Here is a full list of my accomplishments at Ronday:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> I designed 130 wallboards (75 final versions), 3 user flows, and 4 high fidelity wireframes
                    </li>
                    <li> I created the majority (90%+) of the Ronday Help Center.</li>
                    <li> I wrote a user research plan. Then using that plan, I participated in 3 user interviews, and
                        led 3
                        more. </li>
                    <li> I performed competitive research on 13 competitors and presented my findings to the company.
                    </li>
                    <li> I also directed, recorded, and edited 5 Twitter advertisements and a Discord bot advertisement.
                    </li>
                    <li> Participated in countless design discussions to improve the Ronday platform. </li>
                </ul>
