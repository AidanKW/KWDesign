                    <b>Summary:</b> For my master’s thesis, I completed a first-person Somaesthetic design project
                    around the sensation of “rocking”. The final result is a shape-changing pillow called the “Neck
                    Hammock”.

                <p class="pgrey">For my master's thesis I explored a field of design which has strong originas from my
                    graduate school KTH in Sweden. Somaesthetic Design is a holistic framework for designing and
                    evaluating aesthetic experiences. By aesthetics, I mean a core principle that defines an
                    interaction’s qualities. This framework makes use of the “soma”, i.e. the body, emotions, and
                    interactions we feel with the world around us.

                    I decided that the sensation I wanted to explore was rocking. I believed rocking meant something
                    different to me as a dancer, than someone else as a parent. Could I communicate my understanding of
                    rocking to another person?

                    After 22 first-person Feldenkrais-inspired investigative sessions, and 3 prototypes, I was
                    successful in recreating my version of rocking.
                    <br><br>
                    To do this, I constructed a neck pillow which made use of 2 air pumps controlled by Arduinos. For
                    the full experience, earplugs and an eye mask were used to block out the other senses. The results
                    of which were profoundly impactful. If you have ever used or heard of a sensory deprivation chamber,
                    this created a similar experience. The Neck Hammock differed however because it evoked a very
                    specific
                    visualization; rocking.

                <p class="pgrey">This project is near and dear to my heart. Designing on something so relaxing and
                    pleasant to use was such a delight. Unfortunately, I did this project during the start of the
                    COVID-19 pandemic, and so my access to materials were heavily limited. I would have liked to try
                    stronger air pumps, different materials, and 3D printing an interface.
