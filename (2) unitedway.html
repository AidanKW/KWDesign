                    <b>Summary:</b> While working at Ronday, I volunteered at a non-profit in Georgia to perform a
                    usability and accessibility assessment of their website. Following the Web Content Accessibility
                    Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, I produced a 7 page
                    document detailing areas of improvement. Following this document, I began designing and testing a
                    free online tool for others to check website accessibility.

                    <b>Skills: </b>WCAG expertise, UX Design, UX Copy.

                    <b>Time spent: </b>2 months.

                <p class="pgrey">To begin my volunteer work, I had a
                    conversation with Lauren Lynn, the United Way representative, about their needs. She expressed the
                    importance of accessibility and having a resource that <i>they</i> could use to improve later on.
                    Therefore, after I conducted a comprehensive accessibility review of their current website, I
                    created a resource that would enable them to assess accessibility independently in the future.


                    <br><br>My primary focus was using clear
                    and inclusive language, as I found the WCAG very difficult to read. I have already shared this
                    resource with United Way and another non-profit organization. I eagerly await their feedback so I may
                    continue to improve this resource.
