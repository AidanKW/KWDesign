                    I taught myself web development so that I could code this website from scratch! This is the 3rd
                    iteration of the website, and I like it a lot. I use Figma for design and Github for version
                    control.<br><br>

                    This platform is the culmination of multiple usability reviews, learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript,
                    and many hours of coding. Even now the website is continuously updating to be more accessible, more
                    readable, and more modern. I continue to apply what I have learned with the Nielsen Norman Group,
                    and from my Computer Science degrees to make this website contain as much "me" as possible. <br><br>
