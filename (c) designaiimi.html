                    As a UX designer, I believe in creating cohesive and user-centered experiences that not only meet user needs but also
                    reflect a brand's identity. By developing a design system for a company and using it to recreate their homepage, I
                    demonstrate my ability to translate abstract design principles into tangible, functional interfaces.<br><br>

                    Therefore, as a design exercise, I have recreated the homepage for the AI company Aiimi using a simple design system I
                    created. I took care to balance speed and precision. I chose Aiimi because AI is near and dear to me. I studied AI
                    before the AI boom, and while there are areas where use of AI is problematic, what Aiimi is doing absolutely nails it in
                    terms of practicality. AI is especially well equipped to handle large amounts of data. On top of that, they have an 
                    exciting design going for their website - I couldn't resist! <br><br>
                    
                    
                    For comparison, see their homepage: <a href="https://www.aiimi.com/" target="_blank">www.aiimi.com</a>
