                    For this project, I repurposed a garden light set to make a shirt which lights up when the wearer is
                    hugged. I was tasked with using a solar powered garden light set to make a fresh and exciting
                    physical interaction. The whole project took around 2-3 hours.When embracing someone, the lights
                    turn on! The lights themselves were also very bouncy, which was an added bonus when the hug lasted a
                    bit too long. Super silly and goofy. Very much my style! <br><br> It was super fun! This project was
                    a simple and sweet exercise in material exploration. I like silly springy lights, thinking
                    creatively, and consensual hugs!
