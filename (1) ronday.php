                    <b>Summary:</b> For my first design job, I worked at the tech startup Ronday Technologies on their
                    online 3D conferencing and hangout platform. As to be expected of startup work, I performed a myriad
                    of tasks both design-related and otherwise.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Skills: </b>UX Design, UX Copy, User Research, Competitive Analysis, Graphic Design, Video
                    Directing, Video Recording, & Video Editing
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Time spent: </b>7 months.

                    I made 130 wallboards (75 final versions), 3 user flows, 4 high fidelity wireframes,
                    and a user research plan. I wrote the overwhelming majority of the Ronday Help Center, including
                    recording numerous short tutorials. I also participated in 3 user interviews, and individually led 3
                    more. I performed competitive research on 13 competitors. I assisted with 2 project demos, and
                    staffed 2 paid events. I also directed, recorded, and edited 5 Twitter advertisements. In addition,
                    I created the Ronday Discord server, and the advertisement video used to promote it. All of this, in
                    addition to countless design discussions to improve the Ronday platform.

                    <br><br>
                    The results speak for themselves. My wallboards are the default images on all of Ronday's most
                    popular maps. My Twitter Ads boast a conversion rate 20x higher than the industry average. My
                    research results have guided major decisions for the company.

                <p class="pgrey">Working at a tech startup is an exciting and rewarding experience that I would highly
                    recommend to
                    anyone interested in the tech industry. I found it delightful to work on an innovative project with
                    such a passionate team. I also had ample opportunities for self-growth, as I had to teach myself
                    graphic design, video editing, and more.
