            <p class="pgrey"> Hello hello! My name is Aidan (he/him), and I am a goofy and extremely self-driven person. I delight myself in trying all that this world has to offer. So, I firmly believe that my favorite hobby is to find new hobbies! Here are some examples:
            </p>
            <ul class="pgrey">
                <li>Card and coin magic</li>
                <li>Woodworking</li>
                <li>Music (piano, drums, and flute)</li>
                <li>Camping and hiking</li>
                <li>VR Games</li>
                <li>Swing and Blues dancing</li>
                <li>Baking and cooking</li>
                <li>Building computers</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pgrey">Whether its trying a new hobby, or meeting someone new, I always have a blast! Next I want to explore 3D printing. </p>

            <p class="pgrey"> Before I found my complete love of design, I tried many things! I came very close to being a dance instructor, computer engineer, and a Greek and Roman classicist. I decided to pursue design because I adore the intersection of creative work, widespread impact, innovative technology, and getting to talk to so many different people!

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p class="pgrey"> I also love nature and architecture. Whenever I travel, I love to take walks around the area and find a local caf√©. Lastly, I am a big pet person! I lean more towards cats than dogs though. <br><br>

            I hope you've enjoyed getting to know me a little better! Embracing life with a curious and adventurous spirit has led me down various paths, and each experience has contributed to shaping the person I am today. As I embark on my journey in the world of design, I'm thrilled to explore the endless possibilities and create meaningful connections with people like you.
